# HN Who Is Hiring Notifier

Script that checks every minute if the latest HackerNews hiring post is live.

## Usage
```
./alert-when-hn-hiring-post-published.sh 'August 2017'
```

When the post goes live, if you're on a MacOS machine you'll get a popup. If you're not on a Mac, well, nothing interesting will happen.
